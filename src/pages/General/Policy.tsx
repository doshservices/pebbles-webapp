					<h3>1. Our Mission.</h3>
					<p>
						Our mission is to create a world where you can belong anywhere. From
						cabins to castles to music festivals, to fun fiesta to concert and
						shows from top music acts browse through millions of Listings to
						find the ones that fit the way you like to travel. Learn more about
						a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host profile,
						and Guest reviews. If you have questions, just message the Host.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id='searchandbooking'>
					<h3>2. Searching and Booking on Pebbles Signature.</h3>
					<p>
						<em>2.1 Searching.</em> You can search for Host Services by using
						criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel
						dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your
						search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your
						search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price,
						availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history,
						popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements
						(e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						<em>2.2 Booking.</em> When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to
						pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price,
						applicable fees like Pebbles Signature’s service fee, offline fees,
						taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively,
						“Total Price”). You are also agreeing that Pebbles Signature
						Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified
						during checkout. When you receive the booking confirmation, a
						contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these
						Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host. The cancellation
						policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements
						identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your
						contract with the Host. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host
						or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						<em>2.3 Accommodation Reservations.</em>An Accommodation reservation
						is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the Accommodation.
						The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your
						stay, to the extent:
					</p>
					<ol type='I'>
						<li>It is reasonably necessary</li>
						<li>Permitted by your contract with the Host</li>
						<li>Consistent with applicable law</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave
						in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing
						reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number
						of allowed Guests.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>2.4 Reservations</em> for Experiences and Other Host Services.
						An Experience or other Host Service reservation entitles you to
						participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are
						responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet
						minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are
						responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical
						conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to
						participate, attend, or use the Host Service. Except where expressly
						authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service
						unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking
						process.
					</p>
					<h3 id='cancellation'>
						3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.
					</h3>
					<p>
						<em>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds.</em> In general,
						if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you
						is determined by the <a href=''>cancellation policy</a> that applies
						to that reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take
						precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If
						something outside your control forces you to cancel a reservation,
						you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our{' '}
						<a href=''>Extenuating Circumstances Policy.</a> If the Host
						cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our{' '}
						<a href=''>Guest Refund Policy</a> ), you may be eligible for
						rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the{' '}
						<a href=''>Guest Refund Policy</a>. Different policies apply to
						certain categories of Listings; for example, Experiences
						reservations are governed by the{' '}
						<a href=''>Experiences Guest Refund Policy</a> . See each Policy for
						details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each
						situation.
					</p>
					<p>
						3.2 Booking Modifications. Guests and Hosts are responsible for any
						booking modifications they agree to make via Pebbles signature
						Platform or direct Pebbles signature customer service to make on
						their behalf
						<em>("Booking Modifications")</em> , and agree to pay any additional
						amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.
					</p>
					<h3 id='responsibility'>
						4. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.
					</h3>
					<p>
						<em>4.1 Your Responsibilities.</em> You are responsible and liable
						for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the
						acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to
						any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service. For example,
						this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation
						(and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you
						arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with
						respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are
						booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a
						minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on
						behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the
						supervision of that minor.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>4.2 Your Assumption of Risk.</em> You acknowledge that many
						activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum
						extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk
						arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and any
						Content (as defined in Section 10), including your stay at any
						Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other
						Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members
						whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to
						investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for
						you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily
						injury, disability, or death, and you freely and wilfully assume
						those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.{' '}

			<section id='host-terms'>
				<h2>Host Terms</h2>
				<h3 id='hostingonpebbles'>5. Hosting on Pebbles Signature.</h3>
				<p>
					<em>5.1 Host.</em> As a Host, Pebbles Signature offers you the
					opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host
					Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing
					it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you
					host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>5.2 Contracting with Guests.</em> When you accept a booking
					request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Pebbles
					Signature Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the
					Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the
					terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also
					agreeing to pay applicable fees like{' '}
					<a href=''>Pebbles Signature’s service fee</a> (and applicable{' '}
					<a href=''>taxes</a> ) for each booking. Pebbles Signature Payments
					will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree
					to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you
					include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be
					consistent with these Terms, our
					<a href=''>Policies</a>, and the information provided in your Listing,
					and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>5.3 Independence of Hosts.</em> Your relationship with Pebbles
					Signature is that of an independent individual or entity and not an
					employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Pebbles Signature,
					except that Pebbles Signature Payments acts as a payment collection
					agent as described in the Payments Terms. Pebbles Signature does not
					direct or control your Host Service, and you agree that you have
					complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at
					what price and on what terms to offer them.
				</p>
				<h3 id='managing'>6. Managing Your Listing.</h3>
				<p>
					<em>6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing.</em> Pebbles Signature
					Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage
					a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information
					about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees,
					resort fees, security deposits, <a href=''>offline fees,</a> and any
					rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are
					responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar
					availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all
					times. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your
					Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and
					conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only
					maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings
					for a single property if it has multiple places to stay. Any offer of
					an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations.</em> You are responsible for
					understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and
					contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host
					Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and
					condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting,
					short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning
					or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential
					properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a
					permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services
					(such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food,
					serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In
					some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited
					altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who
					stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create
					tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For
					example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction
					laws that may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn
					what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information
					we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes
					only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are
					responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others
					in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including
					our <a href=''>Host Privacy Standards.</a> If you have questions about
					how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>6.3 Search Ranking.</em> The ranking of Listings in search results
					on Pebbles Signature Platform depends on a variety of factors,
					including these main parameters:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, time and duration of
						the trip, price range),
					</li>
					<li>
						Listing characteristics (e.g. price, calendar availability, number
						and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, Host status,
						age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),
					</li>
					<li>
						Guest booking experience (e.g. customer service and cancellation
						history of the Host, ease of booking),
					</li>
					<li>
						Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off
						time), and
					</li>
					<li>
						Guest preferences (e.g. previous trips, saved Listings, location
						from where the Guest is searching).
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Search results may appear different on our mobile application than
					they appear on our website. Pebbles Signature may allow Hosts to
					promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Pebbles Signature
					Platform by paying an additional fee. More information about the
					factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our
					current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted
					Content can be found in our <a href=''>Help Center</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>6.4 Your Responsibilities.</em> You are responsible and liable for
					your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and
					omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host
					Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing
					rules and requirements for your Listing. You must describe any and all
					fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any
					additional fees or charges outside the Pebbles Signature Platform
					except those expressly authorized by our{' '}
					<a href=''>Offline Fee Policy</a>. Do not encourage Guests to create
					third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact
					information, or take other actions outside Pebbles Signature Platform
					in violation of our <a href=''>Off-Platform Policy.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization.</em> If you work with a
					co-host or host as part of a team, business, or other organization,
					the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host
					Services is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms. If you
					accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that
					you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team,
					business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in
					good standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If
					you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are
					authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Airbnb to
					transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or to
					send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and
					are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any
					payout information you provide.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>6.6 Your Assumption of Risk.</em> You acknowledge that hosting
					carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk
					arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform, offering
					Host Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether
					in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity to
					investigate Pebbles Signature Platform and any laws, rules,
					regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or
					Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law
					made by Pebbles Signature.
				</p>
				<h3 id='cancelationandissues'>
					7. Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Booking Modifications.
				</h3>
				<p>
					<em>7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues.</em> In general, if a Guest
					cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the
					cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. As a host, you
					should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our
					Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If you cancel on a
					Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee
					and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest experiences a Travel Issue (as
					defined by the Guest Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance
					arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled under Section 13 of these
					Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund
					or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs
					we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a Guest receives a refund
					after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and
					other costs incurred by Pebbles Signature exceeds your payout, Pebbles
					Signature may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting
					the refund against your future payouts. You agree that Pebbles
					Signature’s Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and
					these Terms pre-empt the cancellation policy you set in situations
					where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the
					issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably expect to provide a
					refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of
					any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made. If
					you Host an Experience, please note that the Experience Cancellation
					Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation
					fees and consequences apply to your reservations. See each Policy for
					details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each
					situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>7.2 Booking Modifications.</em> Hosts and Guests are responsible
					for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via Pebbles Signature
					Platform or direct Pebbles Signature customer service to make on their
					behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes
					associated with a Booking Modification.
				</p>
				<h3 id='taxes'>Taxes</h3>
				<p>
					<em>8.1 Host Taxes.</em> As a host, you are responsible for
					determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to
					report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or
					other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes{' '}
					<em>("Taxes").</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>8.2 Collection and Remittance by Pebbles Signature.</em> In
					jurisdictions where Pebbles Signature facilitates the collection
					and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and
					authorize Airbnb to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such
					Taxes to the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected
					and/or remitted by Pebbles Signature are identified to Members on
					their transaction records, as applicable. Pebbles Signature may seek
					additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts
					from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or
					remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax
					obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected
					by Pebbles Signature is a refund from the applicable Tax authority.
					You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice
					to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes
					in any jurisdiction for any reason.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>8.3 Tax Information.</em> In certain jurisdictions, Tax
					regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information
					about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail
					to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to
					support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we
					may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until
					sufficient documentation is provided. You agree that Pebbles Signature
					may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT,
					GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate
					accurate tax reporting by you, our Guests, and/or their organizations.

				<h2>General Terms</h2>
				<h4 id='reviews'>9. Reviews. </h4>
				<p>
					After each Host Service, Guests and Hosts will have an opportunity to
					review each other. Your Review must be accurate and may not contain
					any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that
					violates our
					<a href=''>Content Policy</a> or
					<a href=''>Review Policy</a>. Reviews are not verified by Pebbles
					Signature for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.
				</p>
				<h4 id='content'>10. Content.</h4>
				<p>
					Parts of Pebbles Signature Platform enable you to provide feedback,
					text, photos, audio, video, information, and other content
					(collectively, <a href=''>“Content”</a>). By providing Content, in
					whatever form and through whatever means, you grant Pebbles Signature
					a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual,
					sub-licensable and transferable license to copy, modify, prepare
					derivative works of, distribute, publish and otherwise exploit, that
					Content, without limitation. If Content includes personal information,
					our <a href=''>Privacy Policy</a> describes how we use that personal
					information. Where Airbnb pays for the creation of Content or
					facilitates its creation, Airbnb may own that Content, in which case
					supplemental terms or disclosures will say that. You are solely
					responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you
					either own it or are authorized to grant Airbnb the rights described
					in these Terms. You are responsible and liable if any of your Content
					violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of
					any third party. Content must comply with our{' '}
					<a href=''>Content Policy</a> and{' '}
					<a href=''>Non-discrimination Policy,</a>
					which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory, obscene,
					harassing, deceptive, violent, and illegal content. You agree that
					Airbnb may make available services or automated tools to translate
					Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or
					tools. Airbnb does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of
					translations and Members are responsible for confirming the accuracy
					of such translations.
				</p>
				<h4 id='fees'>11. Fees.</h4>
				<p>
					Pebbles Signature may charge fees (and applicable Taxes) to Hosts and
					Guests for the use of Pebbles Signature Platform. More information
					about when service fees apply and how they are calculated can be found
					on our <a href=''>Service Fees page.</a> Except as otherwise provided
					on the Pebbles Signature Platform, service fees are non-refundable.
					Pebbles Signature reserves the right to change the service fees at any
					time, and will provide Members notice of any fee changes before they
					become effective. Fee changes will not affect bookings made prior to
					the effective date of the fee change. If you disagree with a fee
					change you may terminate this agreement at any time pursuant to
					Section 13.2.

				</h3>
				<p>
					<em>13.1 Term.</em> The agreement between you and Pebbles Signature
					reflected by these Terms is effective when you access Pebbles

				<p>
					<em>13.2 Termination.</em> You may terminate this agreement at any
					time by sending us <a href=''>an email</a> or by deleting your
					account. Pebbles Signature may terminate this agreement and your
					account for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice via email or
					using any other contact information you have provided for your
					account. Pebbles Signature may also terminate this agreement
					immediately and without notice and stop providing access to Pebbles
					Signature Platform if you breach these Terms, you violate our
					Policies, you violate applicable laws, or we reasonably believe
					termination is necessary to protect Pebbles Signature, its members, or
					third parties. If your account has been inactive for more than two
					years, we may terminate your account without prior notice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>13.3 Member Violations.</em> If (i) you breach these Terms, our
					Policies, or our Standards, (ii) you violate applicable laws,
					regulations, or third-party rights, or (iii)Pebbles Signature believes

					<li className='round-list'>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For minor violations or where otherwise appropriate as Pebbles
					Signature determines in its sole discretion, you will be given notice
					of any intended measure by Pebbles Signature and an opportunity to
					resolve the issue. You may appeal actions taken by us under this
					Section by contacting customer service. If a reservation is cancelled
					under this Section, the amount paid to the Host will be reduced by the
					amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other
					costs we incur as a result of the cancellation.

				<p>
					<em>13.4 Legal Mandates.</em> Pebbles Signature may take any action it

					any of your Content. If your access to or use of the Pebbles Signature
					Platform has been limited, or your Pebbles Signature account has been

					If a Member provides evidence that another Member damaged their real
					or personal property
					<em>("Damage Claim"),</em> the complaining Member can seek
					compensation through the <a href=''>Resolution Center</a>. If the
					complaining Member escalates a Damage Claim to Pebbles Signature, the

					Pebbles Signature via Pebbles Signature Payments can collect any sums
					required to cover the Damage Claim from the responding Member and/or
					against any security deposit. You agree that Pebbles Signature may
					seek to recover from you under any insurance policies you maintain and

				<h3 id='role'>16. Pebbles Signature’s Role.</h3>
				<p>
					We offer a platform that enables Members to publish, offer, search
					for, and book Host Services. While we work hard to ensure our members
					have great experiences using Pebbles Signature, we do not and cannot
					control the conduct of Guests and Hosts. You acknowledge that Pebbles
					Signature has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor
					the use of Pebbles Signature Platform and verify information provided
					by our members. For example, we may review, disable access to, remove,
					or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve Pebbles Signature
					Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment,
					investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’
					compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the
					order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other
					administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) address Content that
					we determine is harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in
					these Terms; and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility
					criteria, including by removing Listings that don’t meet quality and
					eligibility criteria. Members acknowledge and agree that Airbnb
					administers its <a href=''>Policies</a> (such as our{' '}
					<a href=''>Extenuating Circumstances Policy</a>) and{' '}
					<a href=''>Standards</a>
					(such as <a href=''>basic requirements for hosts</a> ), including
					decisions about whether and how to apply them to a particular
					situation, at its sole discretion. Members agree to cooperate with and
					assist Pebbles Signature in good faith, and to provide Pebbles
					Signature with such information and take such actions as may be
					reasonably requested by Airbnb with respect to any investigation
					undertaken by Airbnb regarding the use or abuse of the Pebbles
					Signature Platform. Pebbles Signature is not acting as an agent for
					any Member except for where Pebbles Signature Payments acts as a
					collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.
				</p>
				<h3 id='accounts'>17. Member Accounts.</h3>
				<p>
					You must register an account to access and use many features of
					Pebbles Signature. Registration is only permitted for legal entities,
					partnerships and natural persons who are 18 years or older. You
					represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity barred from
					using Pebbles Signature Platform under the laws of Nigeria, your place
					of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction. You must provide
					accurate, current, and complete information during registration and
					keep your account information up-to-date. You may not register more
					than one account or transfer your account to someone else. You are
					responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your
					account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third
					party. You are responsible and liable for activities conducted through
					your account and must immediately notify Airbnb if you suspect that
					your credentials have been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise
					compromised. If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have
					no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other
					information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your
					identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases
					or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv)
					obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex
					offender registrations or their local equivalents.

						Pebbles Signature has completed a relevant verification or
						identification process and nothing else. The disclaimers in these
						Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. If you have

				<p>
					Neither Pebbles Signature (including its affiliates and personnel) nor
					any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the

					negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether
					or not Pebbles Signature has been informed of the possibility of such
					damage, even if a limited remedy set out in these Terms is found to
					have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligation to
					transmit payments to Hosts under these Terms, or make payments under
					the Pebbles Signature Host Guarantee or Japan Host Insurance, in no
					event will Pebbles Signature’s aggregate liability for any claim or
					dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your
					interaction with any Members, or your use of or inability to use
					Pebbles Signature Platform, any Content, or any Host Service, exceed:
					(A) to Guests, the amount you paid as a Guest during the 12-month
					period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, (B) to Hosts,
					the amount paid to you as a Host in the 12-month period prior to the
					event giving rise to the liability, or (C) to anyone else, one hundred
					U.S. dollars (US$100). These limitations of liability and damages are
					fundamental elements of the agreement between you and Pebbles
					Signature. If applicable law does not allow the limitations of
					liability set out in these Terms, the above limitations may not apply
					to you.

					contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions
					shall apply irrespective of the choice of the Nigerian law. As a
					consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings relating to these
					Terms before the competent court of your place of residence or the
					competent court of Pebbles Signature's place of business in Nigeria.
					If Pebbles Signature wishes to enforce any of its rights against you
					as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in
					which you are a resident. If you are acting as a business, you agree
					to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nigerian courts.

					24. United States Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement.
				</h3>
				<p>
					<em>24.1 Application.</em> This Arbitration Agreement only applies to
					you if your country of residence or establishment is the United
					States. If your country of residence or establishment is not the
					United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim
					against Airbnb in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will
					apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this Section
					24 applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including
					residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process.</em> Pebbles
					Signature is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
					resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part
					process for individuals to whom this Section 24 applies: (1) an
					informal negotiation directly with Pebble’s Signature customer service
					team (described in paragraph 24.3, below), and if necessary (2) a
					binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
					Association <em>(“AAA”)</em>. You and Pebbles Signature each retain
					the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to
					arbitration.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						24.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification.
					</em>{' '}
					At least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Pebbles
					Signature each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in
					writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution.
					You must send your notice of dispute to Pebbles Signature.
					<br />
					<br />
					Pebbles Signature will send its notice of dispute to the email address
					associated with your account. A notice of dispute must include: the
					party’s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of
					the dispute, and the relief sought. If the parties are unable to
					resolve the dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either
					party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						24.4 Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Pebbles Signature mutually
						agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
						relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination,
						validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the
						Pebbles Signature Platform, Host Services, or any Content
						(collectively,
					</em>
					“Disputes”
					<em>) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the</em>{' '}
					“Arbitration Agreement”).{' '}
					<em>
						If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can
						be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Pebbles Signature
						agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement.</em> You and Pebbles
					Signature each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims
					for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be
					brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction
					(as defined by Section 22 of the Terms of Service for Non-European
					Users): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened
					infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights,
					trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
					rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive
					relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or
					commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for
					the remedy of public injunctive relief; or (iv) any individual claim
					of sexual assault or sexual harassment arising from your use of the
					Airbnb Platform or Host Services. You and Pebbles Signature agree that
					the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the
					arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action,
					and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to
					section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</em> This Arbitration
					Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the
					Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural
					interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will
					be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration
					Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable
					by the AAA (the “ <em>AAA Rules</em> “) then in effect, except as
					modified here. The AAA Rules are available at{' '}
					<a href='https://www.adr.org/' target='_blank'>
						www.adr.org.
					</a>{' '}
					In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand
					(available at{' '}
					<a href='https://www.adr.org/' target='_blank'>
						www.adr.org.
					</a>
					) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as
					specified in the AAA rules.

					<em>
						24.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location.
					</em>{' '}
					In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Pebbles
					Signature agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be
					conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S. county where you reside;
					(b) in San Francisco County; (c) via phone or video conference; or (d)
					if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the
					arbitrator.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.9 Arbitrator’s Decision.</em> The arbitrator’s decision will
					include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
					arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be
					entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may
					award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or
					injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only
					to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
					individual claim.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.10 Jury Trial Waiver.</em> You and Pebbles Signature
					acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by
					jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings.</em> You and
					Pebbles Signature acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent
					permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a
					plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit,
					class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other
					representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing,
					the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and
					may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
					proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable
					law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as
					to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim,
					cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of
					action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to
					arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. In
					the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed
					pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims,
					causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to
					arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of
					action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.12 Severability.</em> Except as provided in Section 24.11, in
					the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed
					illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the
					remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and
					effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> If Pebbles Signature
					changes this Section 24 after the date you last accepted these Terms
					(or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject
					that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within
					30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new change,
					however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier
					agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb (or your
					prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in
					effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Pebbles
					Signature.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>24.14 Survival.</em> Except as provided in Section 24.12, and
					subject to Section 13.6 of the Terms of Service for Non-European Users
					this Section 24 will survive any termination of these Terms and will
					continue to apply even if you stop using the Pebbles Signature
					Platform or terminate your Pebbles Signature Account.
